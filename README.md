EC2 DESCRIPTION

# WHAT IS EC2 AUTOSCALING ?

Auto Scaling helps you maintain application availability and allows you to dynamically scale your Amazon EC2 capacity up or down automatically, according to conditions you define.

Amazon Web service provides Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling services to overcome this failure. Auto Scaling ensures that Amazon EC2 instances are sufficient to run your application. You can create an auto-scaling group which contains a collection of EC2 instances. You can specify a minimum number of EC2 instance in that group and auto-scaling will maintain and ensure the minimum number of EC2 instances. You can also specify a maximum number of EC2 instances in each auto scaling group so that auto-scaling will ensure instances never go beyond that maximum limit.



You can also specify desired capacity and auto-scaling policies for the Amazon EC2 auto-scaling. By using the scaling policy, auto-scaling can launch or terminate the EC2 instances depending on the demand.
